# Mbo'ehára — project guide for Claude Code

Mbo'ehára is a fun, gamified web app for learning **Guaraní** (Paraguay's co-official
native language). Its 12 levels mirror how Guaraní is taught in Paraguayan schools
(grades 1–12), following the MEC *Ñe'ẽ* program progression.

## How to run it
No build step, no dependencies (Node/npm are not installed and not needed).
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, **or**
- Serve the folder: `python3 -m http.server` then visit the printed URL.

## Architecture (vanilla JS, no framework)
Scripts load in this order (see `index.html`):
1. `js/data/curriculum.js` — `CURRICULUM`: the 12 grades → lessons → vocab. **Most content edits happen here.**
2. `js/data/index.js` — `grades` alias + learner `RANKS` / `rankForLevel()`.
3. `js/i18n.js` — `i18n` object: ES/EN UI strings (`I18N`), language toggle, `i18n.meaning({es,en})`.
4. `js/progress.js` — `Progress`: localStorage state (XP, level, streak, completed lessons, stars, grade unlocks).
5. `js/game.js` — `Game`: builds exercises from a lesson's vocab and runs the lesson loop (hearts, scoring, stars).
6. `js/app.js` — `App`: the three screens (Home/world-map, Grade/lesson-list, Profile) + top-bar.

Also `js/speech.js` — `Speech`: approximate pronunciation via browser SpeechSynthesis
(falls back to a Spanish voice; loaded before `game.js`). `Speech.btn(gn)` returns a 🔊
button; clicks are handled by global delegation in `Speech.init()` (called from `App.init`).

Other files: `css/styles.css` (white minimalist theme, CSS variables in `:root`),
`assets/mascot.svg` (Jasy Jateré stick-figure mascot).

## Data shape
- A grade: `{ id, num, color, icon, title:{es,en}, lessons:[...] }`
- A lesson: `{ title:{es,en}, vocab:[ {gn, es, en}, ... ] }`
- Exercises are **generated** from `vocab` by `Game.build()` — you don't author exercises by hand.
  Types: multiple choice (both directions), build-the-word, true/false, matching.

## Conventions
- Every user-facing string is bilingual `{es, en}`; render with `i18n.meaning(pair)` or `i18n.t(key)`.
  When adding UI text, add the key to **both** `es` and `en` in `js/i18n.js`.
- Guaraní orthography matters: nasal tildes (ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ ỹ) and the glottal stop `'` are significant.
- Keep the aesthetic white/minimalist; reuse existing CSS variables and classes.
- Progress persists in `localStorage` under `mboehara.progress.v1`; bump the key if the shape changes.

## Common tasks
- **Add/fix vocabulary** → edit `CURRICULUM` in `js/data/curriculum.js`.
- **Add a new grade/lesson** → add to `CURRICULUM` following the data shape; unlock logic is automatic.
- **Add UI text** → add the key to both languages in `js/i18n.js`.
- **Tune gamification** (XP, hearts, unlock threshold) → `js/progress.js` and `js/game.js`.

## Content caveat
The Guaraní vocabulary is an educational **draft** from standard references — worth a
native-speaker/teacher review before classroom use.
